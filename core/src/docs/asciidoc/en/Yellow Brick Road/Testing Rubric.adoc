== *JustServe.org: Yellow Brick Road Testing Rubric*

*Purpose:* To classify user journeys within JustServe.org based on their importance and frequency of use, thereby guiding the allocation and intensity of testing resources. This rubric is designed to be used in tandem with a detailed persona matrix. +
*Core Principle:* Journeys classified as the "Yellow Brick Road" represent the most critical and frequently used paths. These require the most rigorous testing across the widest range of user contexts (defined by the persona matrix).

*How to Use:*

. *Identify Journeys:* Define specific start-to-finish user tasks on JustServe.org (e.g., "Find and view local projects," "Register a new account," "Submit a new project for approval").
. *Classify Journeys:* Evaluate each journey against the criteria below to assign it a "Road Type" (Level 1-4).
. *Integrate Persona Matrix:* Combine the Road Type with your persona matrix (user types, locations, privileges, devices, languages) to generate specific test cases. For example, a Level 1 journey must be tested across all high-priority combinations defined in the matrix.

|*2* |*City Streets* |*Important, frequent paths supporting core functions or key user groups.*

• *Frequency:* High/Medium

• *Criticality:* Important

• *Impact of Failure:* Significant (Hinders key tasks)

• *Personas:* Specific core or moderate range |

*Review & Iteration:* This rubric should be a living document. Regularly review the classification of journeys based on analytics data (if available), user feedback, and changes to JustServe.org's features and priorities. Ensure the testing strategy remains aligned with how users actually interact with the platform.
